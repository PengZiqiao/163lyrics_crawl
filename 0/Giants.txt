Through silence
Hear the thunder in you
I know your mind is
Looking for a truth

Don't need reminding
We're living proof
So walk with me and I'll walk with you

So now we're standing on the edge
Our backs against the wall
A penthouse view
On our own two
And now we're standing tall

We can be giants giants
We can be giants giants
'cause every one of us
Has always been in love
We can be giants giants

In the chaos
Our kingdom fell
Stole heaven
So we gave'em hell
In the pieces
We found ourselves
So fight for me
I'll fight as well

So now we're standing on the edge
Our backs against the wall
A penthouse view
On our own two
And now we're standing tall

We can be giants giants
We can be giants giants
'cause every one of us
Has always been enough
We can be giants giants

We can be giants giants
We can be giants giants
'cause every one of us
Has always been enough
We can be
We can be giants

We can be giants giants
We can be giants giants
'cause every one of us
Has always been enough
We can be giants giants
