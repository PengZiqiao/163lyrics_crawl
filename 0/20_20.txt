Back then always thought that you had my back
You were just there to stab it
Hindsights 20/20 should've seen it then
Maybe I should get glasses
Screw me over like you didn't know my name
Oh I was so convenient
I don't know why you wanna play me like a game
True colors show

Now I can see
Exactly who you are pretending
We used to be alright don't lie
Cause now I can see
That you were never honest with me
I will never let you back into my life

さっきまでここにいたはずの
あなたはどこへ?
一切見返りを求めない
なんて嘘ならべ
何かが壊れる音がしても
なお絶妙なバランスで
首の皮一枚つながったお前さ

Now I can see
Exactly who you are pretending
We used to be alright don't lie
Cause now I can see
That you were never honest with me
I will never let you back into my life

Now I can see
Exactly who you are pretending
We used to be alright

Now I can see
Exactly who you are pretending
We used to be alright don't lie
Cause now I can see
That you were never honest with me
I will never let you back into my life
