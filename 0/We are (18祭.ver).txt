We are, we are, we are
They think that we’re no one
we’re nothing, not sorry
They push us
It’s too late, it’s too late Not going back
夢は終わり 目を覚ます時
絶望や希望も 同時に目を覚ました
鏡に映った 僕が問いかける
自分を誤魔化し 生きることは意味はあるか
When you’re standing on the edge
So young and hopeless
Got demons in your head
We are, we are
No ground beneath your feet Now here to hold you
‘cause we are, we are
The colours in the dark
酷く痛む 鼓動は早く
遠のく景色を この手で摑もうとした
They are the weakest
They don’t even know
Anything they say
Will never break our hearts of gold
When you’re standing on the edge
So young and hopeless
Got demons in your head
We are, we are
No ground beneath your feet Now here to hold you
‘cause we are, we are
The colours in the dark
Never tell yourself
You should be someone else
Stand up tall and say I’m not afraid, I’m not afraid
So never tell yourself
You should be someone else
Stand up tall and say I’m not afraid
Taka：我慢すんな！感情むき出しでいけ！
When you’re standing on the edge
So young and hopeless
Got demons in your head
We are, we are
No ground beneath your feet Now here to hold you
‘cause we are, we are
The colours in the dark
When you’re standing on the edge
So young and hopeless
Got demons in your head
We are, we are
No ground beneath your feet Now here to hold you
‘cause we are, we are
The colours in the dark
When you’re standing on the edge
So young and hopeless
Got demons in your head
We are, we are
No ground beneath your feet Now here to hold you
‘cause we are, we are
The colours in the dark
taka：最高！
