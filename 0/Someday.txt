Sometimes I thinking about,
If I can go back to those good-days
Whereas another day comes and I know it's too late
儚く残った想い出と手放した多くの永遠が
今 僕に別れの意味を教えてくれた
I wanna see you again someday I wish
I wanna hear your voice again
何一つ僕は 変えられなくて
いつになったって I can't
I know that there will be end
it's too hard I have to say good-bye
you're now gone out of my hands
No happy ending not for us
絶え間なく降っている雨も
何気なく撮った写真さえも
君の痛みを聴く度に蘇るようだった
I wanna see you again someday I wish
I wanna hear your voice again
何一つ僕は 変えられなくて
いつになったって
I wanna touch you again someday I wish
I wanna talk to you again
今すぐに僕は 追い掛けたくて
何度やったって I can't
Why did you have to go?
Why did I let you go?
Maybe we could have been
Now, Can you hear my voice?
Now, Can you feel my voice?
I sing for you right now!!
The day you told me the meaning of gift you gave me
Wanted you to take me away from here
I wanted to go from here to somewhere. to somewhere.
The day you told me the meaning of gift you gave me
Wanted you to take me away from here
I wanted to go from here to somewhere. to somewhere.
I wanna see you again someday I wish
I wanted to go from here to somewhere.
I wanna see you again someday I wish
I wanna hear your voice again
何一つ僕は 変えられなくて
いつになったって
I will be where you are now with you
I will be able to feel you
空白の最後 終わりはなくて
いつか僕だって I will see you
终わり 完
