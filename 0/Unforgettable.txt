Who is the person you see when you look closer
Who am I going to be when it's all over
Sacrifice but it's worth the price
It's for the moment that lives on
Bury me in the melody to remember when I'm gone
Who is the person you see when you look closer
Closer
More than the face you see in the crowd
They know my name when they scream it loud
I don't need much
I just want it all
All I wanna be is unforgettable
I'm in control of the fire
Cause I hold the matches
Some of the best things in light are born from the ashes
Sacrifice but it's worth the price
For the moment that lives on
Bury me in the melody to remember when I'm gone
I'm in control of the fire
Watch while they catches
Catches
More than the face you see in the crowd
They know my name when they scream it loud
I don't need much
I just want it all
All I wanna be is unforgettable
I don't need much
I just want it all
All I wanna be is unforgettable
Sacrifice but it's worth the price
It's for the moment that lives on
Bury me in the melody to remember when I'm gone
More than the face you see in the crowd
They know my name when they scream it loud
I don't need much
I just want it all
All I wanna be is unforgettable
Unforgettable
Unforgettable
Unforgettable
All I wanna be is unforgettable
