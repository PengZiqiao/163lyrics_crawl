 作曲 : toru/taka
What do you want from me?
Just let me breathe a little
What do you want to see?
目に見えるモノ?
What do you want to believe?
Still nothing can be settled
Hold on your words you say It's no good
何を求め そして何を受け入れる?
2つに1つ!! 僕にはまだそれが I don't know
となりで笑う君は
Hey Liar, Hey Liar
What do you think of living without me?
Hey Liar, Hey Liar
何がウソでどれが真実?
Must be a dream I see
まるでデジャヴのよう
Trying so hard to know inside of you
Staring your eyes to feel
この思いが届くようにと
願うけど理想とはウラハラ So cold
となりで微笑む君…
Hey Liar, Hey Liar
あれもこれもウソじゃもう
I'm tired, so tired
What do you think of living without me?

There is nothing left to bleed
My heart can't take this any more
There is nothing left to bleed
My heart can't take this any more
Hey Liar, Hey Liar
What do you think of living without me?
ねぇ Liar, Oh yeah Liar
とどまる事は無意味??
