Keep your enemies close
Your enemies close
Keep your enemies close
Your enemies close
Keep your enemies close
Your enemies close
Keep your enemies close
Your enemies close
I cut you off but you're still here
You're like a whisper in my ear
You start soft but you're getting louder
Every hour I feel the power
We go hard till the morning light
We battle nightly
"Keep your enemies..."
Bedroom warfare in the middle of the night
Out of nowhere you come back into my life
And I know in the morning we'll be
Nothing more than each other's enemy
Bedroom warfare in the middle of the night
Keep your enemies close
Your enemies close
Keep your enemies close
Your enemies close
Keep your enemies close
Your enemies close
Keep your enemies close
Your enemies close
It's like I never had a chance
We're doing a dangerous dance
It's not a fair fight when you're already naked
Your body language is so persuasive
We go hard 'till the morning light
We battle nightly
"Keep your enemies..."
Bedroom warfare in the middle of the night
Out of nowhere you come back into my life
And I know in the morning we'll be
Nothing more than each other's enemy
Bedroom warfare in the middle of the night
Keep your enemies close
Your enemies close
Keep your enemies close
Your enemies close
Keep your enemies close
Your enemies close
Keep your enemies close
Your enemies close
I cut you off but you're still here
Bedroom warfare in the middle of the night
Out of nowhere you come back into my life
And I know in the morning we'll be
Nothing more than each other's enemy
Bedroom warfare in the middle of the night
