Sometimes my heart feels lonely
There was nowhere like home where I could feel complete
I realized that this place here is my real home
And you were always by my side and believed in me all of the time
You are my light
We just want to be with you in this moment forever
'Cause I want to find precious memories
You will tell the story on when these dreams will come true
So let's keep on walking 'til we reach the end
'til we reach the end
One day when your in the dark and can't see the light again
Just remember the time with us
It's alright
We can do now anything as long as we're with you
And a million dreams shared between the two of us now
It's all true
We just want to be with in this moment forever
'Cause I want to find precious memories
You will tell the story on when these dreams will come true
So let's keep on walking 'til we reach the end
'til we reach the end
We were crushed again & again
Surrounded by darkness
We won't lose the sight of the light anymore
And we will forever and ever hold you hands
'Cause we are with you now
I don't want to miss the way to you like that anymore
You will be the storyteller now with us
We just want to be with in this moment forever
'Cause I want to find precious memories
You will tell the story on when these dreams will come true
So let's keep on walking 'til we reach the end
'til we reach the end
