 作词 : MY FIRST STORY
 作曲 : MY FIRST STORY
Will you dance on the floor with me?
Will you drink to the night with me?
Just give me the reason for you standing here alone
Will you leave out the rest with me?
Will you come to my place with me?
All I know is you will be mine for one time tonight
You can’t get over to my heart
You can’t get over what we had
I wanna Try Try Try Try and I know
You can’t say what I have to do
You can’t say what you want from me
I seem to Fly Fly Fly Fly Away
That’s all there’s now
儚い感情を穢して夢の中に堕ちれば
何時か君の愛も染まるから
濡れた純情が淦れて僕の声を求めれば
最後の涙も枯れるから
I can’t be sorry for you now
I can’t be every day with you
You’re gonna Cry Cry Cry Cry for you
I can’t go where you want to go
I can’t go where I need to lie
You shouldn’t Dry Dry Dry Dry for me
That’s all there’s now
Will you dance on the floor with me?
Will you drink to the night with me?
Just give me the reason for you standing here alone
Will you leave out the rest with me?
Will you come to my place with me?
All I know is you will be mine for one time tonight
You said.
I’m not the only one,but I want to stay here
Don’t you think I’m crazy
You said.
I’m not the only one,but you can’t leave me
‘Cause we will just keep going on
