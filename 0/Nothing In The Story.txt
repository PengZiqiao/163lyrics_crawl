Do you still remember when I couldn't see the way ?
Those worries kept on going on But it's finally over
I don't want to go to those worries anymore
I am doing what I can so I won't go that way now

We can't stop in to waste on time in this same place anymore
And we won't stay here forever
There's nothing you can say
Cause it's too late to close our position that we achieved
This is not the final destination, we are in the story, back again

この僕の中から離れて欠け続けていた
まだ何もかも…

I don't want to go to those worries anymore
I am doing what I can so I won't go that way now

今まで集めた想いが…

We can't stop in to waste on time in this same place anymore
And we won't stay here forever
There's nothing you can say
Cause it's too late to close our position that we achieved
This is not the final destination, we are in the story, back again

We will keep on trying on again and again
Whenever we did that, we felt like we were the one losing
We will do what we want

When I fall down, when I break down
I will always think again
When I fall down, when I break down
I will always think again

失った心が千切れかけても僕だって
全てを賭けてきたから

We can't stop in to waste on time in this same place anymore
And we won't stay here forever
There's nothing you can say
Cause it's too late to close our position that we achieved
This is not the final destination, we are in the story, back again
