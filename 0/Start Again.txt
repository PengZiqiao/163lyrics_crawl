This is where I draw the line
Seen this war a million times
Looking for a peace of mind
Now you hate what we've become
Say the word let's be done
There is something in the way
I'm not always perfect
But I'm always myself
If you don't think I'm worth it
Find someone else
I won't say I'm sorry
For being who I am
Is the end a chance to start again
Hard to say what's all round
What it this all along
I'm so close you're so gone
We can fate the way we are
I can't change
It's my heart
It's nothing left to say
I'm not always perfect
But I'm always myself
If you don't think I'm worth it
Find someone else
I won't say I'm sorry
For being who I am
Is the end a chance to start again
I know I know I know it's not easy
You can leave here anytime
You know you know you know it's just not right
I'm not always perfect
But I'm always myself
If you don't think I'm worth it
Find someone else
I won't say I'm sorry
For being who I am
Is the end a chance to start again
