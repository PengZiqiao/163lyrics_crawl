When I was just a kid
I couldn't wait till I grew up
Tried walking in your shoes
But I couldn't even tie them up
No matter how big and tall I grew
I was always looking up to you
You showed me that I was just a diamond in the rough
You help me to grow into the man that I've become
We've been down
We've been up
I hope I've made you proud enough
You make it look easy
Even when I'm hard to love
When I dropped out of school
You told me that my time was up
I was the rebel with the cause
Just didn't know quite what it was
So I got a job that barely paid
You said you did the same thing at my age
You showed me that I was just a diamond in the rough
You help me to grow into the man that I've become
We've been down
We've been up
I hope I've made you proud enough
You make it look easy
Even when I'm hard to love
We've been down
We've been up
I hope I've made you proud enough
You make it look easy
Even when I'm hard to love
Even when I'm hard to love
