Walking through the silent town
And missing all the faces while going straight on through the crowd
Staring at the ground
As if the time had stopped and I had been there left behind
Oh Well, Oh Well,
新しい明日の為に
Oh Well, Oh Well,
何度でも掴んで
We can change the world with our two bare hands
We can change the world with our own clear heads
今までを受け止めて真っ直ぐに進みだすの
Just for tonight

Always the fear in my mind
Cause everything is made of all kinds of relationships
Don't know what comes to me
That's why just keep on living with never looking back again
Oh Well, Oh Well,
まだ何も分からなくても
Oh Well, Oh Well,
その先に向かえば
We can change the world with our two bare hands
We can change the world with our own clear heads
今までを受け止めて真っ直ぐに進みだすの
Just for tonight

生まれ落ちた世界は小さくない筈なのに歩き続けてた
僕の場所　失かったんだろう？
初めから辛くても道程は遠くても締めきれなくて
最後まで探してるの
果てしない夢の日々が僕達を彩るから
変わらない思い出に包まれて起き上がるの
We can change the world with our two bare hands
We can change the world with our own clear heads
今までを受け止めて真っ直ぐに進みだすの
Just for tonight
