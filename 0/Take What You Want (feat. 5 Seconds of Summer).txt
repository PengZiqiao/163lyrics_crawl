Take what you want
Take what you want and go
Come and gone the perfect storm
On and on never ending
Open doors empty arms
Don't look back no pretending
I don't want anything in our broken home
Not the memories or the things we own
Not the picture of us on the wall
So take what you want
Can you hear me?
I'm trying to hear you
Silence strikes like a hurricane
Now I'm singing for you
You're screaming at me
It's hard to see your tears in the pouring rain
Take what you want
Take what you want and go
Just go now just go, go, go
Still remember a time when you felt like home
You and me up against the great unknown
You were my life, now you're out of my life
Yeah I guess that's life
Can you hear me?
I'm trying to hear you
Silence strikes like a hurricane
Now I'm singing for you
You're screaming at me
It's hard to see your tears in the pouring rain
Take what you want
Take what you want and go
Take it no reason for me to hold on
(Look in my eyes I'm letting go)
Keep it don't need it, don't need it, don't need it!
Take what you want
Take what you want and go
Can you hear me?
I'm trying to hear you
Silence strikes like a hurricane
Now I'm singing for you
You're screaming at me
It's hard to see your tears in the pouring rain
Take what you want
Take what you want and go
Can you hear me?
