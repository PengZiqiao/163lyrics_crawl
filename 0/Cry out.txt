Cry Out
ONE OK ROCK

Switch the light off welcome to the night
What's the problem not gonna make it right
Bite the bullet, then pull the trigger, hold tight
(It's a feeling you know)
言葉を飲み込んだ君の
何かを訴える目つきは
例えられないくらい冷たい
(Take Take Take Take it for no one)
But I don't know what to call it
When I know I don't care anymore
いたずらに過ぎ去ってた昨日

Cry out will you tell me now
So we say we want changing and never be the same
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah
Cry out Oh I'm burning out
Can't you hear this sound
(Voices all around)
(Cause we're going down)

全てが裏腹な僕の弱みを掴もうとしても
さらに固く閉ざしてみせるの
(I don't take **** for no one)
それでも強引な君はなにかをチラつかせて見せて
あたかも平然を装うの
(Take Take Take Take it for no one)
But I don't know what to call it
When I know I don't care anymore
In the end I know we'll all be gone

Cry out will you tell me now
So we say we want changing and never be the same
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah
Cry out Oh I'm burning out
Can't you hear this sound

One by one it's taking apart it's taking a part of me
Can't you hear the voices screaming
All out to me I'm feeling
We can be the change we needed
Shout it out now
Shout it out now
Can't you hear the voices screaming
All out to me I'm feeling
We can be the change we needed
Shout it out now
Shout it out now

Cry out will you tell me now
So we say we want changing and never be the same
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah
Cry out Ohh burn it out
Can't you hear this sound
(Voices all around)
Can't you hear this sound
(Cause we're going down)
(Voices all around)
(Cause we're going down)
