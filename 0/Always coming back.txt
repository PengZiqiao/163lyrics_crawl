I'm always coming back to you

Some nights we fight we scream
We don't know what to do

But I guess it's just the simple things
That people they go through

But another night the glimpse I see
The real one and that's you
And I know that nothing will stop me from standing up
I can
I'm always coming back to you

You've got me till the end
I'm always coming back to you

You keep pulling me here

I'm always coming back

Oh wow time goes by yeah

Oh wow time goes by
背を向ければ
向けるほどに愛しく

向き合えば合うほど
離れていきそうで
形のない不確かなものを探す

And I know that nothing can stop me from standing up
I can
I'm always coming back to you
You've got me till the end
I'm always coming back to you

You keep pulling me here

I'm always coming back

Oh wow time goes by yeah

Oh wow time goes by oh

明日もしも君がそこにいなくても

怖くないって言えるぐらい
強くなるよ

I've got to find a way and a place
To keep you here with me
Some nights we fight we scream
We don't know what to do

But I guess it's just the simple things
That people they go through

Oh wow time goes by yeah

Oh wow time goes by
Time time goes by
Oh time time goes by
Some nights we fight we scream
We don't know what to do

But I guess it's just the normal things
That people they go through
