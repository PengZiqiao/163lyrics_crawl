I move along
Something's wrong
I guess a part of me is gone
Skies are gray
Start to fade
I guess I threw it all away

Sometimes I just wanna quit
Tell my life I'm done with it
When it feels too painful
Sometimes I just wanna say
I love myself but not today
When it feels too painful
I smash my broken heart of gold
I smash my broken heart of gold

Tired soul
Dying hope
I guess l'm running out of road
I guess l've got nowhere

Sometimes I just wanna quit
Tell my life I'm done with it
When it feels too painful
Sometimes I just wanna say
I love myself but not today
When it feels too painful
I smash my broken heart of gold
I smash my broken heart of gold
I smash my broken heart of gold

Feels like l'm dying
Feels like l'm lying to myself
I know that l'm trying
But it feels like I'm in hell
I'm in hell

Sometimes I just wanna quit
Tell my life l'm done with it
When it feels too painful
Sometimes I just wanna say
I love myself but not today
When it feels too painful
I smash my broken heart of gold
I smash my broken heart of gold
I smash my broken heart of gold
