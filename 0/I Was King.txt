We say tonight no going back
Nothing seems right, stuck in the past
When am I, when am I gonna start living?
When am I, when am I gonna move on?
When am I, when am I gonna kill this feeling?
When am I, when am I gonna stop this dreaming?
When I was king, I was king, we had everything
When am I, when am I gonna start living?
When I was king, I was king, we had everything
When am I, when am I gonna start living?
Don’t wanna go, I’m holding on tight
Something to live for, make it all night
Shut down the sirens in our heads
When I was king, I was king, we had everything
When am I, when am I gonna start living?
When I was king, I was king, we had everything
When am I, when am I gonna start living?
When I was king
I was king
I was king
I was king
If I go down, I will go down fighting,
I’ll go down, down like lightning
If I go down, I will go down fighting,
I’ll go down, down like lightning
If I go down, I will go down fighting,
I’ll go down, down like lightning
I was king

When am I, when am I gonna start living?
When am I, when am I gonna move on?
When am I, when am I gonna kill this feeling?
When am I, when am I gonna stop this dreaming?
When I was king
I was king
When I was king
When I was king, I was king, we had everything
When am I, when am I gonna start living?
When I was king
