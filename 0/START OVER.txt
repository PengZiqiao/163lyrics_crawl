 作词 : ナノ,MY FIRST STORY
 作曲 : MY FIRST STORY
The very first time I looked in your eyes，
I knew there was no turning back.
The very last time you looked in my eyes,
I knew this would be our good-bye.

I pray now
That we'd
START OVER…
We go our ways, just like we'd do each day
And I turn as you're walking away

There's something missing in the way you said
“Hope tomorrow is a better day…”“

Underneath an empty smile,
I can hear a voice is crying,But I hesitate inside
Don't know how to reach you

I just want you to stay with me
There's nothing more I'd ask for now
Unwind the broken days,
As I'm turning back the clock
But it's just a second late
To fix the silent tears
You're crying for me…

You are my light, you are my ray of hope
You brought meaning into this life

I believed that what we shared would never change
Now there's so much I can only regret
Even after all the years
I remember every laughter
And somehow I hope you hear
This song I'm reaching for you

I just want you to stay with me
There's nothing more I'd ask for now
Rewrite a brand new page
As the story must go on
As the memories will grow old
I fight the silent tears
I'm crying for you…

Do you love me just the way I am?
there's nothing that could change us now
'Cause I love you just the way you are
there's nothing that could change us now
I don't know how I could go on without you
If only time would let me live
Then maybe we could both believe

I just want you to stay with me
There's nothing more I'd ask for now
Unwind the broken days
As I'm turning back the clock
But it's just a second late
To fix the silent tears
You're crying for me…
