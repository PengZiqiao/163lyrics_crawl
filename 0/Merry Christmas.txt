I am always thinking about your eyes
I am always waiting to meet you
Whatever you may do
you are so beautiful tonight
There is nothing you have to go and change
There is nothing you need more and more
No matter what I say
you won’t believe me anyway
We will not make a wish on a star
‘Cause it will not come true
This is now a fairytale
so I wanna give you a happy ending now
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas
I will give you my heart
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas
I will take you away
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas
It’s a special day
Merry Christmas
You are always shinning in my mind
You are always looking for the one
There is plenty down right there
You can leave it on the floor
When you are afraid to be alone
When you are lonely I go back
‘Cause you are the only one
And you are amazing, girl you know
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas
I will give you my heart
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas
I will take you away
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas
It’s a special day
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas
You will stay by my side
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas
You will try to enjoy
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas
It’s a special day
Merry Christmas
So open the door
let’s go watch all the light
We can smile underneath the Christmas tree
You and me
After the snow will fall and pile
After I press me lips and smile
Now Santa Claus can fulfill all my dreams
Tell me why I am with you
Tell me why you are with me
Maybe the reason why we are
Always together now and again
I swear to you
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas
Wherever you are
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas
Wherever you are
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas
Will we become one tonight
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas
I will give you my heart
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas
I will take you away
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas
It’s a special day
Merry Christmas
