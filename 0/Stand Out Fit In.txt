I know they don’t like me that much
Guess that I don’t dress how they want
I just wanna be myself
I can’t be someone else
Tried to color inside their lines
Tried to live a life by design
I just wanna be myself
I can’t be someone else
someone else
They yell
They preach
I’ve heard it all before
“Be this”
“Be that”
I’ve heard it before
Heard it before
Big boys don’t cry
Shoot low, aim high
Eat up, stay thin
Stand out, fit in
Good girls don’t fight
Be you, dress right
White face, tan skin
Stand out, fit in
Lately it’s been too much all day
Words shot like a cannon at me
I just wanna be myself
I can’t be someone else
Someone else
They yell
They preach
I’ve heard it all before
“Be this”
“Be that”
I’ve heard it before
Heard it before
Big boys don’t cry
Shoot low, aim high
Eat up, stay thin
Stand out, fit in
Good girls don’t fight
Be you, dress right
White face, tan skin
Stand out, fit in
I am who I am no matter what
Never changing no matter what
No matter what
Big boys don’t cry
Shoot low, aim high
Eat up, stay thin
Stand out, fit in
Good girls don’t fight
Be you, dress right
White face, tan skin
Stand out, fit in
Big boys don’t cry
Shoot low, aim high
Eat up, stay thin
Stand out, fit in
Good girls don’t fight
Be you, dress right
White face, tan skin
Stand out, fit in
