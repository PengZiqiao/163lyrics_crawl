Sick and tired of waiting
So we learned to fly
What a wild ride

Brave enough to make it
And we're here to stay
Yeah we found a way

If you ever feel lost with nowhere to go
We can make a new world where nobody knows
Our place our space, calling home

We're all the way up up up
We'll never look down down down
Breaking the ceiling 'cause I believe the world is ours
We're all the way up up up
We'll never look down down down
I got a feeling that it was written in the stars
Written in the stars

I wasn't born to follow
So I took the lead
I didn't lose the dream

Forget about tomorrow
Bring it on tonight
The sky's burning bright

We're all the way up up up
We'll never look down down down
Breaking the ceiling 'cause I believe the world is ours
We're all the way up up up
We'll never look down down down
I got a feeling that it was written in the stars
Written in the stars

If you ever get stuck with no where to run
When you're covered in clouds, I'll show you the sun
Our time to shine, we've just begun

We're all the way up up up
Breaking the ceiling, 'cause I believe the world is ours
We're all the way up up up
I got a feeling that it was written in the stars
That it was written in the stars
Written in the stars
